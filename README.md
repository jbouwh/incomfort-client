# intouch-client

Python client library for Intergas InTouch-compatible boilers (i.e. attached to a Lan2RF gateway). Includes a CLI. 

Based upon https://github.com/bwesterb/incomfort, but uses **aiohttp** rather than synchronous I/O (e.g. httplib, requests). 

Support for InComfort thermostats will be added in a future version.
